            Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit.('temple of the God of the field') is a Hindu temple roughly 1200 years old dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range[citation needed] near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.

                    <h2>MahabaliPuram</h2>
                    These temples have captivated every traveler. Made from granite, the temple has three sanctums, two of which are dedicated to Lord Shiva and one to Lord Vishnu. These sanctums to date remain the best examples of single rock-cut structures. The temple also houses a number of smaller shrines that complement the larger structure.

                    The actual name of the temple is not known, but given the close proximity to the sea, it is called the Shore Temple. The fascinating fact is that the existing temple is the only one remaining of a complex of seven shrines. The others are considered to be the submerged temples of Mahabalipuram.
